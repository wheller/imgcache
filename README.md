Simple Web Image Resolving and Caching Utility NPM Module

*Still in experimental state, please check back soon*


## About
>
>  This library was written originally to supply images for a secure chat client that interfaces with Hubot.
>  The project itself was designed to be a framework for building good npm modules including testing and
>  debugging.  The library is written in CoffeeScript and published in JS for compatibility.  CoffeeScript
>  was selected not because of any particular preference, rather as Hubot itself is written in CS, we needed
>  a good proof of concept for debugging and interacting with CoffeeScript for pure JS developers who may
>  contribute to our more complex code.  At least on our team, good JavaScript developers are much easier 
>  to find than good JavaScript developers who already know CoffeeScript.

>
>  `$ npm test`
>


## Debugging
>
>  Build and Debug<br />

>


## Building
>
>  Transpile CoffeeScript (./src/) to final JavaScript (./lib/)<br />
>  `$ grunt build`
>
>  Or full build with tests and linting<br /> 
>  `$ grunt`
>


## ToDo
>
>  * add options to listen to (or ignore) cache headers
>  * add callback to iscached
>  * add way to specify mimetypes we care about (currently: /image/i )
>  * add promise support
